        <h4 class="text-justify">Leaks.ng is run by a coalition of Nigerian news organisations and civil society organisations that are committed to speaking truth to power. You can send us files and select which of our partner organizations you would like to share the information with. This site provides details on how you can submit your information and what you can do to secure yourself in the process. </h4>

  <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
  <h4>If you have information about issues which should be investigated, share them with one of our partners using this site. Consider that concrete information and evidence, such as source files, gives a journalist more to work with and increases the likelihood that your issue gets taken up.</h4>
  <br>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Leaks.ng is a tool that allows people to send information of public interest to media outlets and civil society organizations through secure technologies that protect the identity of the source. Using transparency and civil participation, it aims to build a fairer and more democratic society.</p>

     <section class="box2">
      <i class="fa fa-microphone logo-small" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      <h2>We amplify your voice</h2>
      <p>The information received through Leaks.ng will be verified, analyzed and published by the partners of our alliance, made up of civil organizations and media outlets. The main goal is that the impact of the information revealed is amplified, on a social and legal level.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>Security is an integral part of our project. Leaks.ng uses advanced digital security technologies designed exclusively for whistleblowing. It is essential that all instructions on this site are followed closely so that the identity of the whistleblower is protected. See <a href="#security">'Secure yourself'</a> for more details. If done correctly, even ourselves will not know the origin of the information.</p>

     <section class="box4">
      <i class="fa fa-user-secret logo-small" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      <h2>Anonymity</h2>
      <p>The identity of our sources is protected with technological solutions: in Nigeria, the Constitution recognizes freedom of expression, of information and the right to secrecy on behalf of journalists. All media outlets have the obligation and the right to protect the identity of their sources, even in a legal procedure.</p>

    <h2>SECURE YOURSELF</h2>
    <h4>Leaking sensitive information is not free of risk. There social as well as technical risks involved that can threaten your anonymity. You can however, take precautionary measures to protect yourself.</h4>

  <div class="row slideanim">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 col-md-offset-1 hidden-xs">
      <p><Strong>Social Risks</Strong></p>
        <p class="text-justify">Before you leak information, you should be aware of what can and will happen with the information that you have leaked and how it could possibly be published. You can ask yourself the following questions for example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are you the only person with access to this information? In other words, can it be directly related back to you personally?</li>
              <li>Are you aware that, after the information has been published, people can ask you questions about the leaked information, even without knowing you are the source?</li>
              <li>Can you handle the pressure that comes with a possible internal or external investigation about the leaked information?</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Technological Risks</strong></p>
          <p class="text-justify">You should be aware that whenever you use a computer, mobile phone or the internet, or other forms of communication, most of these actions will leave traces. Investigators could use that kind of information to help identify you, your whereabouts or your contacts. You can take very specific risk mitigating precautions to prevent you from leaving such electronic traces. Your computer, for example, could leave traces as a result of the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Visiting a whistleblower platform such as Leaks.ng, Globaleaks or Wikileaks;</li>
              <li>a copy of the information you yourself leaked to such a whistleblower platform;</li>
              <li>the uploading of the information itself;</li>
              <li>correspondence with journalists involved with the whistleblower platform;</li>
              <li>your name and other information in Word file meta data (author, date, etc);</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">As you can see, there are various risks involved and the ones listed above are by no means all of them. Yet with a few technical steps you can try to minimize these risks as much as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Security</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">When it comes to the social security aspect, you should at least take the following into consideration:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Before and after leaking the information, tell absolutely no-one that you will do so or have done so;</li>
                  <li>after the leaked information has hit the media, be careful when sharing your opinion on the matter;</li>
                </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 hidden-xs">
                <ul>
                  <li>ensure that there are no monitoring or surveillance systems in place when you upload the information (such as security cameras for example);</li>
                  <li>do not use search engines or news websites looking specifically for the information you leaked. This could arouse suspicion about your involvement;</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">These are just a few simple measures that you can take to better protect yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>Technical Protection</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">Because computers and networksystems are complex, technical measures to protect your anonymity are often complicated. To ensure the technical security of your anonymity for as far as reasonably possible, you need to be computer-savvy enough to understand these risks yourself.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">By following the procedures listed below, you will greatly enhance your anonymity:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle software</a> for surfing the web anonymously. This is easy to use software.</li>
                  <li>Besides using the Tor Browser Bundle you should also use BleachBit, which will thoroughly clean up your machine and get rid of cookies, logs, etcetera.</li>
                  <li>Do not upload information from your own work or home computer, use an internet cafe instead.</li>
                  <li>Do not keep a copy of the leaked information yourself.</li>
                  <li>Ensure that you do not leave a trace of the leaked information on computer systems. Remove all the files from a USB disk you may have used, then fill the USB drive with music, movies or photos. To ensure the files can no longer be recovered, format the drive(s) and then overwrite the free space multiple times using security tools.</li>
                  <li>Some information might contain meta-data, such as the author and date that the file was written or the type of camera a photo was made with. Try to remove any and all meta-data that is not relevant to the leaked information and might expose you personally.</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">By following the procedures listed above and taking into consideration the social risk factors, you will greatly increase your chances of remaining anonymous. This does not mean that your anonymity will be 100% protected and ensured. To increase your general knowledge on digital security we recommend reading: SecurityInABox.org. This website explains many common risks involved with electronic communications and ways to mitigate them.</p>

      <h4>The Whistle-blower Policy is not a Law of the National Assembly but it was approved by the Federal Executive Council in December 2016. The policy authorises government to recover stolen or concealed assets through information provided by a whistleblower, then he/she may be entitled to between 2.5% - 5.0% of amount recovered.</h4>
      <h4>The policy does not provide ANY immunity from civil or criminal prosecution. What this means is that if during the investigation some of the evidence links a whistle-blower to partaking in the act of corruption or a related incident, the whistle-blower would not be immune from criminal prosecution. He/she could technically be charged for a crime that they helped blow the whistle on.</h4>
      <h4>The Nigerian Senate has however passed the ‘Whistle blower protection bill’ after its third reading at plenary. The aim of the bill is to ensure the protection of whistleblowers with reliable information on the war against corruption.</h4>
